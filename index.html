Along with my continuing self study with hours resembling those of bootcamp, I gained valuable experience from collaborating as a Junior Developer at Solvana <em> (an ecommerce solar energy startup)</em> for six months. Here I propelled my knowledge of React and JavaScript to a whole new level, as well as learn new frameworks/libraries such as TypeScript, Material-UI, Jest and Yup. </p> <p class=paragraph contenteditable=true> &nbsp; &nbsp; In April of 2021, I was hired as a Frontend Developer at EarthCam <em>(the leading network of live streaming webcams for tourism and entertainment)</em>, where I have been employed ever since. I've continued to work daily with JavaScript and React, often being the go-to person other team members turn to for questions & assistance on such. I've learned a good deal about Angular as well, of which I knew next to nothing about when I joined. I work regularly with private NPM packages that share domain logic across multiple applications. Some of proudest contributions include motion detection capabilities, full accessibility implementation with WAI-ARIA attributes that update in real time and advanced, yet simple to use interactive maps built with Leaflet.js. </p> <p class=paragraph contenteditable=true> &nbsp; &nbsp; As a result of my technical prowess coupled with my tenacity for nonstop learning and improving, I’m confident I’d be a valuable asset as a <strong class=Position></strong> at <strong class=Company></strong>. As such, I look forward to speaking with you about any potential next steps. </p> <span id=consideration>Thank you for your consideration.</span> <h3 id=regards> Best regards, </h3> </article> <a href=# id=link>Download</a> </div> </div> </body> </html>
