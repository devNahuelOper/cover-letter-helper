            coding aficionado, who thrives on generating top quality systems

            &nbsp; &nbsp; I acquired my foundations at App Academy, where I
            spent 1,000+ hours mastering a primary stack consisting of
            JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails and SQL, along with other
            technologies such as: Git/GitHub, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, jQuery,
            Express, HTML5, CSS/Sass, MongoDB, AWS and Heroku.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; My time spent since July 2020, when I graduated from
            App Academy, is where I've gotten the chance to grow exponentially
            as a developer. While I attribute a sizable portion of this growth
            to a combination of taking additional courses and the continuous
            implementations of bigger and better features in my projects, it is
            my time working as a Junior Developer at Solvana
            <em> (an ecommerce solar energy startup)</em>, that has been most
            instrumental. In the past couple of months at Solvana, I've added
            several new technologies to my repertoire, such as TypeScript, AWS
            Lambdas, React Hooks, Material-UI and Jest, in addition to cementing
            my skills in all that is JavaScript/React/Redux.

          <p class="paragraph" contenteditable="true">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; As a result of my technical prowess coupled with my
            tenacity for nonstop learning and improving, I’m confident I’d be a
            valuable asset as a <strong class="Position"></strong> at
            <strong class="Company"></strong>. As such, I look forward to
            speaking with you about any potential next steps.
